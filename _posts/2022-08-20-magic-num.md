## MagicNum

### Challenge

To solve this level, you only need to provide the Ethernaut with a `Solver`, a contract that responds to `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()` with the right number.

Easy right? Well... there's a catch.

The solver's code needs to be really tiny. Really reaaaaaallly tiny. Like freakin' really really itty-bitty tiny: 10 opcodes at most.

Hint: Perhaps its time to leave the comfort of the Solidity compiler momentarily, and build this one by hand O_o. That's right: Raw EVM bytecode.

Good luck!

### Background

So this was challenge that too me the longest compared to the rest, even though I'm fairly confidednt with touching bytecode and have seen the Ethereum VM and its bytecode before. Even though I was ranther confident that I could write basic some functionality in raw EVM bytecode and I have seen all the details that I would need to get this going, I have never put them together.

So I will try to summarize the basics here.

#### Bytecode

Understanding the EVM bytecode is actually fairly simple, its just a Harvard-Architecture stack based machine with most functionality you would expect from any machine such as push, pop, load, store, add, xor etc. Other than that it has some special functionality that is specific on the blockchain, like how you interact with other contracts, and how to access blockchain specific variables such as the value sent with a transaction etc. I have a rather strong background in comptuer architecture (started a PhD which I never finished) so this was not a problem to me.

The opcodes that are needed for this challenge are the `PUSH1`, `CODECOPY` and `RETURN` opcodes, nothing else!

* `PUSH1` is an opcode that takes a 1-byte immediate argument and pushes it to the stack
* `CODECOPY` is an opcode that will pop three values off the stack `destOffset`, `offset` and `length` and copy from `offset` in the code segment into `destOffset` in memory `length` bytes.
* `RETURN` is an opcode that will pop two values off the stack `offset` and `length` and will return `length` bytes to the caller starting from `offset` in memory

For further details there is a plethora of resources online, so I will be just leave a few here

* [opcodes](https://www.ethervm.io/)
* [yellowpaper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf)

The assembly of the opcodes is also straight forward. Each of the three instructions has a single byte identifier, and `PUSH1` takes a second byte as its argument. The encoding is in big-endian. 

In the following example

```
// return(offset=0, length=32)
PUSH1 0x20    // length -- opcode: 0x6020
PUSH1 0x00    // offset -- opcode: 0x6000
RETURN        //        -- opcode: 0xf3
```

the bytecode would become `0x60206000f3`.

#### Contract Interaction

Most people are familiar with solidity, and solidity is a high level language and has the notion of functions. We can interact with a contract using multiple different functions, for example we can call the `transfer` function or the `approve` function on an `ERC20` contract. One could think that the offset to which code should execute could depend on the function called, but that is not the case. The EVM is similar to a standard binary in that regard. When the contract is called, its code is loaded and execution starts from the entry point (which for EVM is the first byte in the code -- no ELF stuff here).

The notion of function calls is build in the contract call its self. The code loaded will parse the data that is provided to it and decide what to do. If its solidity code, it will most likely check if the provided method identifier is known and do what it has to do accordingly. If its not solidity code it could do something else. In our case it will just start executing our code. Again in this regard its like a standard binary. It loads and executes, if you have logic in order to do special functionality depending on user input, it will, otherwise it will just do what it was programed to do.

#### Deployment

The final part is deploying the contract. Once more I had the understanding of what this was, and what its purpose was, but never got to work with it in any detail. So the way it works is this, when a contract is deployed the transaction data is executed as EVM bytecode and whatever is returned by it, is stored as the contract code.

At first I thought that hardhat `ContractFactory.deploy` would handle this for me, so I wrote a simple payload that just returns 42. I thought that the ABI and the bytecode should have enough information to be able to call the constructor. But it probably does not, the deploy function expects the deploy bytecode. What ended up happening was a smart contract with only a single byte of bytecode, this was an invalid opcode with id 42!

```
$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8545 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getCode","params":["0xf9c5166Fc52A96a3B47D5724DB645CC7E7a06108", "latest"],"id":1}' | jq
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002a"
}
```

While I wasn't sure what was going on I changed the ABI of the `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife` function to a state changing function and called it so that I could debug it using its transaction hash. There is probably a more elegant way to do this but it did the job.

Running `debug_traceTransaction` on the transaction hash gave this

```
$ curl -s http://localhost:8545 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"method":"debug_traceTransaction","params":["0xb03b4da8727bfa90b7a8ba3dee28942beb2899bc0cb0f26384f17600e8bcf0a8"],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}' | jq
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "gas": 21052,
    "failed": false,
    "returnValue": "",
    "structLogs": [
      {
        "pc": 0,
        "op": "STOP",
        "gas": 0,
        "gasCost": 0,
        "depth": 1,
        "stack": [],
        "memory": [],
        "storage": {}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Attack

#### Payload

In order to get this to work I need 2 pieces of bytecode. The main bytecode that will be executed and the deployment bytecode. The main bytecode should be limited to a max of 10 opcodes. The simplest solution would look like this.

```
// mstore(0x00, 0xa2)
PUSH1 0xa2  // bytecode 0x60a2
PUSH1 0x00  // bytecode 0x6000
MSTORE      // bytecode 0x52
// return(0x00, 0x20)
PUSH1 0x20  // bytecode 0x6020
PUSH1 0x00  // bytecode 0x6000
RETURN      // bytecode 0x3f
```

The question that naturally arises is where should this be placed for it to work as expected. And as already mentioned above, if this is the start of the smart contract code then any code that hits the contract will simply execute this bytecode. As simple as that. No need for method identifiers or payable checks or anything.

If we assemble the bytecode would look like `0x60a2600052602060003f` which is 10 bytes long.

#### Deployment

In order to deploy this contract, a piece of code needs to be written that will return the bytecode above.

```
// copycode(0x00, 0x0c, 0x0a)
PUSH1 0xa2  // bytecode 0x600a
PUSH1 0x00  // bytecode 0x600c
PUSH1 0x00  // bytecode 0x6000
COPYCODE    // bytecode 0x39
// return(0x00, 0x0a)
PUSH1 0x20  // bytecode 0x600a
PUSH1 0x00  // bytecode 0x6000
RETURN      // bytecode 0x3f
// payload follows
// ...
```

If we assemble the bytecode would look like `0x600a600c600039600a60003f` which is 12 bytes long.

This code will copy from the code being executed (the data of the transaction in this case) starting from position 12 to memory at position 0 for 10 bytes. If we skip the fisrt 12 bytes we land exactly after the deployment bytecode, hence the start of the payload bytecode. Then this memory region is returned.

#### Combining Payload and Deployment bytecode

The final EVM assembly would look like this

```
// -------- DEPLOYMENT --------
// copycode(0x00, 0x0c, 0x0a)
PUSH1 0xa2  // bytecode 0x600a
PUSH1 0x00  // bytecode 0x600c
PUSH1 0x00  // bytecode 0x6000
COPYCODE    // bytecode 0x39
// return(0x00, 0x0a)
PUSH1 0x20  // bytecode 0x600a
PUSH1 0x00  // bytecode 0x6000
RETURN      // bytecode 0x3f

// -------- PAYLOAD    --------
// mstore(0x00, 0xa2)
PUSH1 0xa2  // bytecode 0x60a2
PUSH1 0x00  // bytecode 0x6000
MSTORE      // bytecode 0x52
// return(0x00, 0x20)
PUSH1 0x20  // bytecode 0x6020
PUSH1 0x00  // bytecode 0x6000
RETURN      // bytecode 0x3f
```

And the final bytecode would look like this `0x600a600c600039600a60003f60a2600052602060003f`.

We should keep in mind that the the opcode limit is on the contract code, and not the deployment code, so this would satisfy the constraint.

#### Steps

* Deploy the bytecode above
* Call the `setSolver` function on the target contract with the address of the deployed contract
