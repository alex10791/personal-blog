## Dex

### Challenge

The goal of this level is for you to hack the basic [DEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange) contract below and steal the funds by price manipulation.

You will start with 10 tokens of `token1` and 10 of `token2`. The DEX contract starts with 100 of each token.

You will be successful in this level if you manage to drain all of at least 1 of the 2 tokens from the contract, and allow the contract to report a "bad" price of the assets.

 
#### Quick note

Normally, when you make a swap with an ERC20 token, you have to `approve` the contract to spend your tokens for you. To keep with the syntax of the game, we've just added the `approve` method to the contract itself. So feel free to use `contract.approve(contract.address, <uint amount>)` instead of calling the tokens directly, and it will automatically approve spending the two tokens by the desired amount. Feel free to ignore the `SwappableToken` contract otherwise.

Things that might help:

* How is the price of the token calculated?
* How does the `swap` method work?
* How do you `approve` a transaction of an ERC20?

### Background

This challange has what we would call a logic bug in binary exploitation. The bug is not really in exploiting some bad code but instead the logic allows the attacker to manipulate the outcome of the contract.

This is the first time I look at `DEX` code so I might be way off on this, but it seems that the price calculation is a bit flawed here. The price is supposed to be adjusted depending on the available liquidity in the `DEX`. However, if more than one token is bought at a given liquidity ratio, the same rate is applied for all of the tokens.

It seems to me that under normal circumstances the price needs to be re-adjusted for each token being bought and not for all of them collectivly at once. For example when the ratio `Token1/Token2` is 10 to 1 that means that each `token1` is now priced at `0.1` `token2`. If 10 are bought at once, the price will be `0.1` `token2` for each, or `1` token2 for all, however, it should be `0.1` for the first token, then the ratio will become 9 to 1, so the second token should cost `0.11`, then the ratio would become 8 to 1 so the next should cost `0.125` and so on, and so forth. This would result in a cost close to `3`.

I'm not sure this would completely solve the problem due to the rounding issues that will emerge, but it certainly would not allow such huge swings.

### Attack

In order to drain the one of the two tokens, one needs to buy as many of the one token and then the other over and over until the token is drained. There are two ways of doing this. This can be achieved both using a smart contract or offchain transactions. 

#### Multiple Transactions

* Repeat until one of two tokens is drained:
  * Buy as much of `token2` using `token1` as possible
  * Buy as much of `token1` using `token2` as possible

#### Smart Contract

* Create a contract that can repeat until one of two tokens is drained:
  * Buy as much of `token2` using `token1` as possible
  * Buy as much of `token1` using `token2` as possible
* Transfer all `token1` and `token2` tokens to this contract
* Run the contract function

During the development of the attack, I used offchain transactions as it was easier to play with, however, after the attack was developed, I wrote a smart contract that could do the entire thing in a single transaction in order to save on gas. 

We should keep in mind that even though it requires less transactions in order to drain the walle, it needs an extra two transactions to transfer the the tokens to the contract. Wether or not it is worth it will depend on the amount of transactions required to drain one of the two tokens on the `DEX`.

Also, it a realistic senario it will very likely be worth optimizing the code. I did not bother much here and instead tried to keep it somewhat readable.

### Success Message

As we've repeatedly seen, interaction between contracts can be a source of unexpected behavior.

Just because a contract claims to implement the [ERC20 spec](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) does not mean it's trust worthy.

Some tokens deviate from the ERC20 spec by not returning a boolean value from their `transfer` methods. See [Missing return value bug - At least 130 tokens affected](https://medium.com/coinmonks/missing-return-value-bug-at-least-130-tokens-affected-d67bf08521ca).

Other ERC20 tokens, especially those designed by adversaries could behave more maliciously.

If you design a DEX where anyone could list their own tokens without the permission of a central authority, then the correctness of the DEX could depend on the interaction of the DEX contract and the token contracts being traded.
