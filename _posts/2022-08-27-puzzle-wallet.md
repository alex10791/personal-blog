## Puzzle Wallet

### Challenge

Nowadays, paying for DeFi operations is impossible, fact.

A group of friends discovered how to slightly decrease the cost of performing multiple transactions by batching them in one transaction, so they developed a smart contract for doing this.

They needed this contract to be upgradeable in case the code contained a bug, and they also wanted to prevent people from outside the group from using it. To do so, they voted and assigned two people with special roles in the system: The admin, which has the power of updating the logic of the smart contract. The owner, which controls the whitelist of addresses allowed to use the contract. The contracts were deployed, and the group was whitelisted. Everyone cheered for their accomplishments against evil miners.

Little did they know, their lunch money was at riskâ€¦

You'll need to hijack this wallet to become the admin of the proxy.

Things that might help::

* Understanding how `delegatecall`s work and how `msg.sender` and `msg.value` behaves when performing one.
* Knowing about proxy patterns and the way they handle storage variables.

### Background

This is probably the challange I spent most time on up until now. In order to pass this challange we need to keep in mind that `delegatecall` keeps the context of the caller. This includes the `msg.sender` and `msg.value`. This is very interesting and very different than a normal `call` which would have a new `msg.sender` and `msg.value` associated with them. In a normal `call` a new `msg.value` would be sent along, in a `delegatecall` however, the same `msg.value` would be used and hence could potentially act as if it was received twice. The other important thing to note here is how the slots of the proxy overlap those of the implementation and can therefor be manipulated across the different implementation.

### Attack

The first vulnerability is pretty straight forward to exploit. The `pendingAdmin` and `admin` variable slots in the proxy overlap those of the `owner` and `maxBalance` in the implementation respectively. Since anyone can propose a new admin we can change the `pendingAdmin` in the proxy and as a result change the `owner` in the implementation. Using this technique we can set our own address as the `owner` and then also add our address in the whitelist by calling the `addToWhitelist`. This allows us to bypass the `onlyWhitelisted` modifier and unlocks some new functions for us.

Now all I needed to do is set the `maxBalance` variable to my account address which overlaps the `admin` variable in the proxy contract. The only way to do this is by calling the `init` function or the `setMaxBalance` function. Both functions have a require that will normally `revert`. The `init` function will `revert` if the `maxBalance` is not zero, and the `setMaxBalance` will `revert` if the actual balance is not zero. Since I need to manipulate `maxBalance` to call `init` to manipulate `maxBalance` this approach did not look very promissing. So my focus was on draining the contract balance.

The only way to take funds out of the contract is by calling the execute function, which limits the amount one can take to the recoreded balance. So the balance of the contract is `0.001 ETH` and the recorded balance of account address is `0`. I need to find a way to record at least as much in my balance as the funds in the contract. 

The second vulnerability is not that obvious but the hints make it pretty clear were to look, the `multicall` function `delegatecall`s to the contract its self. The `multicall` function allows us to call multiple functions in the same transaction by providing multiple `calldata` in an array. The reason I spent so much time on this was because I just couldn't see a way to exploit this vulnerability. The comment `// Protect against reusing msg.value` was an obvious hint but I just started falling into a rabbit-hole. I started looking if I could trigger the `execute` function with such data that it would call the `deposit` again or other combinations but it just didn't get anywhere and some scenarios were getting a bit too complex. I think I was drawn into this rabbit-hole because I thought the `data` argument in the call was placed intentionally to make this exercise possible (hint it was not). I also started looking into whether I could call the same function in the proxy contract as someone else but it was just not getting anywhere.

The course of action was kind of clear though. I needed to find a way to deposit the `msg.value` more than once wihtout sending it as many times. If no checks were in place I could simply `deposit` twice and since a `delegatecall` was made the same `msg.value` would be used (without actually resending) the funds. The balance however would be increased twice. The contract though, had some logic to avoid this. Specifically it uses a local variable in the `multicall` function that makes sure the `deposit` is only called once. So it won't be that easy.

And then in occured to me, I could `delegatecall` to the `multicall` function its self, creating a new stack frame with new `depositCalled` initialized to `false`. So all I had to do was to provide two calls to the `multicall` function. The first is a `deposit` function, and then a call to `multicall` which would have a single call to `deposit` once more. 

* Call `proposeNewAdmin` on proxy with the account address to set the `owner` on the implementation
* Call `addToWhitelist` on the implementation with the account address to add the account in the whitelist
* Generate the `calldata` for the `deposit` function
* Generate the `calldata` for the `multicall` functino with arguments an array with only the `deposit` `calldata` generated in the previous step
* Call `multicall` with an array with the `deposit` `calldata` and the `multicall` `calldata` and send a value equal to the funds of the contract
* Call `execute` and withdraw the full amount of the contract
* Call `setMaxBalance` with the account address to set the `admin` on the proxy
