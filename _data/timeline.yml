- title: Special Scientist
  from: 2017
  to: 2018
  description: I started a PhD in Computer Architecture at the University of Cyprus working 
               on different projects such as trying to wave the voltage margines of CPUs for
               application specific executions and protecting the register renaming subsystem
               of dynamically scheduled out of order cores. Unfortunately I did not finish
               as I got a job opportunity and doing both was very difficult time wise. 
               Maybe some day...
              #  tl;dr Was doing changes to a cycle acutrate CPU simulator (sim-alpha) written in C and running experiments

- title: MSc in Computer Science and Engineering (Security)
  from: 2014
  to: 2016
  description: I studied Computer Science and Engineering with a Security studyline and a lot 
               of hardware courses at DTU (Denmarks Technical University). My Thesis was
               on a cross-core cache timing attack sidechannel against AES.

- title: MEng in Electronic and Electrical Engineering
  from: 2010
  to: 2014
  description: I studied Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the University of Leeds. 
               My Thesis was on Surface Plasmon Polariton for Solar Cell energy generation.
               Deriving equations, writing and running simulations, showing graphs. Usuall stuff.
