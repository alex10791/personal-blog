### Pure Race Cube

Assuming no waste, about 8% pip cound lead is a cube, 13.5% is the take point.

* Need to clarify if the percent is refering to the pip difference vs my pips, or vs the opponents pips


### Opening Roles

* 6-4
  * Normaly split with 6 and come down with 4 (24/18 13/9)
  * On gammon go make two point (8/2 6/2)

* 2-1
  * Normaly split with 1 and come down with 2 (24/23 13/11)
  * On gammon go come down and slot the 5 point (13/11 6/5)


### When 2-away 2-away

* Cube with any market loosers even when behind in the score

(Need to confirm this but certainly if ahead)


### Backgame (2-anchor)

Need to get an estimate range of good timings (pip follow) for the following backgames

* 1-2
* 1-3
* 1-4
* 1-5
* 2-3
* 2-4
* 2-5
* 3-4
* 3-5
* 4-5

### MET (Match Equite Table)

These are the MET tables but I still need to wrap my head around them. I need to think a lot about there meaning.
