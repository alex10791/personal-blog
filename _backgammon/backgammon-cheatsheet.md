### Pure Race Cube

Assuming no waste, about 8% pip count lead is a cube, 13.5% is the take point.

* Need to clarify if the percent is referring to the pip difference vs my pips, or vs the opponents pips


### When 2-away 2-away

* Cube with any market losers even when behind in the score

(Need to confirm this but certainly if ahead)
