## Backgame (2-anchor)

An estimate of good pip trail for an x-y backgame is the pips needed to clear the two points. So for a 1-2 backgame it should be (24\*2 + 23\*2 = 94).

```
Formula: 100-2*x-2*y
```

| Roll | Trailing | Quality |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| 1-2  | 94       | Best    |
| 2-3  | 90       | Best    |
| 1-3  | 92       | Best    |
| 2-4  | 88       | Good    |
| 3-4  | 86       | Good    |
| 1-4  | 90       | Average |
| 2-5  | 86       | Average |
| 3-5  | 84       | Poor    |
| 4-5  | 82       | Poor    |
| 1-5  | 88       | Bad     |
